It’s the official unofficial hostel tradition now—everyone gathers in the courtyard at midnight with steaming bowls of Maggi and totally random stories.
There’s zero agenda except laughing at bad jokes, complaining about assignments, and pretending we’re “bonding for networking purposes.” Someone
usually brings a guitar, someone else brings chaos, and by the end, we all forget how stressed we were. It’s simple, slightly silly, and honestly the
best part of college life.
