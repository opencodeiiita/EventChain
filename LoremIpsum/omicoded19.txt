Once every millennium, beings from across galaxies gather on a floating asteroid for a peaceful tea break. Gravity politely takes a pause as conversations drift between black holes, time travel mishaps, and universal snacks. No agendas, no wars—just warm cups of quantum chai and awkward small talk between humans, aliens, and sentient algorithms. Attendance is mandatory only if you exist, have existed, or might exist someday.
