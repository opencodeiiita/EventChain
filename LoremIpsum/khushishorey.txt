Hey!
So somehow I found this to be a very interesting issue (shouldn't be called issue though) and thatswhy instead of 
going to sleep I've decided to become a storyteller to myself and to everyone who will read this in future by any
chance. So being in a college like IIIT Allahabad where events happen like Halley's Comet, once in a blue 
moon, u r left with no option than describing an imaginary event!

So imagine a midnight food counter event where u have stalls ready consisting of delicious, mouth-watering food and
somehow the stalls consist of evrything u like - dosa, pav-bhaji, golgappe....every damnn thing and u can just go 
and eat as much as u want and that too for freeee!!!.....sounds interesting, right? I wish an event like this could 
happen or exist irl coz if it would existed I would have gone and eaten something from there right now
instead of describing it :(

The event imagination was staright out of my hunger....Kindly Ignore.
Thanks!
